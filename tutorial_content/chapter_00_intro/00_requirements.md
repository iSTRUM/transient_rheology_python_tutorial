# Who this tutorial is for

## Domain Knowledge

This book aims to be approachable and useful to students and researchers interested in the upper mantle of the Earth (and other terrestrial planets). It assumes some understanding of the physics and thermodynamics of planetary interiors but if you have at least an advanced-undergrad level of training you should be alright.

## Technical Requirements 

This book assumes some basic Python background.

Assumes that:

1. you are familiar with the Python language
2. you have Python installed (as of this writing, at least Python 3.10 is recommended)
3. you can install python packages with `pip` or `conda`

Are you brand new to Python? There are many resources:
* https://foundations.projectpythia.org/
* add
* more
* links

While this book aims to introduce scientific concepts about transient rheology, it also aims to introduce Python packages
from the Open Source Scientific Python ecosystem as well as to introduce some more general programming princples that are 
not frequently covered in a typical geoscience curriculum.
