# Introduction to Transient Rheology

The earth deforms over many timescales: plate tectonics, driven by mantle convection, occurs over millions to billions 
of years, while seismic waves pass through the earth on the order of seconds to minutes. While these 
processes exert vastly different forces on the earth, those forces are **also** applied over very 
different timescales. The response of the rock will depend not only on the magnitude of 
the force applied but also: (1) the time over which the force is applied and 
(2) the initial state of the rock.

The dependence on time is the essence of transient rheology, or the time-dependent evolution of material properties 
of a crystalline solid **during** deformation. We're talking rock, ice, ceramics, metals!
