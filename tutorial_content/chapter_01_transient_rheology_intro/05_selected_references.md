The overview in this introductory section draws from a number of resources. If you're interested in digging deeper, here are a number of references.

The following papers contain concise overviews with applications to Earth materials with many references to follow:

* Cooper (2002). Seismic Wave Attenuation: Energy Dissipation in Viscoelastic Crystalline Solids, Reviews in mineralogy and geochemistry. https://doi.org/10.2138/gsrmg.51.1.253
* Faul and Jackson (2015). Transient Creep and Strain Energy Dissipation: An Experimental Perspective, Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Science. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-060313-054732

The following notes provide more details at an introductory level:

* Igor B. Morozov, 2024, Methods of Continuum Mechanics in Rock Physics, Lecture notes available at http://seisweb.usask.ca/classes/UPC-2024/WWW/
* Kelly, PA. Solid Mechanics Part I: An Introduction to Solid Mechanics. Lecture Notes available online [here](https://pkel015.connect.amazon.auckland.ac.nz/SolidMechanicsBooks/Part_I/index.html). Chapter 10 contains a wonderfully straightforward overview of transient deformation with descriptions fo Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt and Zener/SLS models. Kelly has other excellent lecture notes [here](https://pkel015.connect.amazon.auckland.ac.nz/SolidMechanicsBooks/index.html).

The following textbooks are excellent resources for comprehensive treatments of viscoelasticity and anelasticity:

* Lakes, R. (2009). Viscoelastic Materials. Cambridge University Press. ISBN: 978-0-521-88568-3. Lakes has some lecture notes online [here](https://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/VE.html), including some [introductory notes](https://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/EMAviscoFr.html) ([internet archive snapshot link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250729105648/https://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/VE.html)).
